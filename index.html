<h2>History</h2>
Lily and Dan were set up by a mutual friend, who has been glowing with vindication ever since. 
<br /><br />
Their first date was at the Life Alive Cafe on Massachusetts Avenue in Cambridge, where Dan ordered a sandwich called “The Bachelor”. Lily privately wondered whether that was meant as a hint. Nevertheless, she was quickly impressed by Dan’s ability to find positivity in the most unexpected places - especially as he described the city of Worcester. Dan was excited almost to the point of skepticism to have found someone he could talk to about art, science, video games, and fiction, and who also happened to be a charming and beautiful woman. She even laughed at his jokes. He remembers gradually learning to just accept his good fortune and stop questioning whether it might all be some kind of hoax.
<br /><br />    
In the time since then, they have enjoyed listening to banjo music during roadtrips, playing grueling games of 20 Questions, forming divisive opinions about opera, crafting lore about their cats and other characters, and sneaking out to midnight movies. Lily and Daniel were married in a small ceremony in New Mexico on August 4, 2024. They’re now excited to be celebrating just up the road from where they first met - and even more excited to see all of you there.
